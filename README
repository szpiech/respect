respect - A program for computing and plotting uni- and bi-variate MAF spectrums

--ndr <int> number of non-data rows that preceed the data
--ndc <int> number of non-data columns that preceed the data
-l <int> number of loci
-r <int> the number of chromosomes sampled
	(for N individuals, this is 2N for diploid)
-s <int> the non-data column index by which populations are determined
-n <int> number of alleles to resample
--threads <int> number of threads to spawn
--seed <int> seed for the RNG, an RNG is allocated for each thread
	and is seeded with seed + thread id (starting at 0)
-f <string> datafile
--overflow <int> if any bins spill over this number, they are colored in the largest bin color
--num-bins <int> number of bin colors to use in the bivariate plots
-o <string> uses this as the base name for output files
--bivariate-all when present the bivariate spectrum is 
	calculated pairwise between all populations
--bivariate-pop1 <string> calculates the bivariate spectrum between the population defined here
	and the one defined by --pop2
--pop2 <string> companion command to --bivariate-pop1
--help when present prints this help
